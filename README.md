# Technology-and-Operations-Management-Case-Study
•	This case study is a detailed analysis and work project for a Bicycle Manufacturing process. Which starts with location prioritization according to specific location morphology using ABC and XYZ Analysis then the calculation of product life cycle according to Overhead cost, Revenue and Profit for each product.

•	Fulfillment of requirement HoQ (House of Quality), BOM. Then creation of Initial Routing and the process clustering according to their required Operations (Sawing, Milling etc.). Furthermore, Calculation of Route sheets, workstation analysis which include WS Type, Operations Time etc. 

•	This project also included the calculation of Material Cost per Strength and Material FOM (Figure of merit). The Bicycle size calculation, required machine hours, required machine numbers, space requirements, Material Flow Matrix, Transportation Matrix, Distances Matrix, Transport Intensity Matrix, Draft Block Layout, MTM Motion Elements, and finally Required operators.
